British Airways Customer Reviews Analysis â€“ Data-Driven Insights for Better Airline Experience

In this Tableau-powered project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of British Airways customer reviews to uncover patterns in passenger satisfaction. The goal was to understand service strengths and improvement areas by visualizing detailed customer feedback trends.

Project Highlights:

  - Multi-Faceted Customer Insights â€“ Analyzed ratings for cabin staff, food, entertainment, ground service, seat comfort, and overall value to assess customer experience.

  - Advanced Filtering & Segmentation â€“ Allowed users to break down data by traveler type (business, solo, family, couple leisure), seat class (economy, business, first, premium economy), aircraft group, and continent for a granular view of     customer satisfaction.

  - Service Benchmarking â€“ Compared different aircraft groups and seating categories to see which flights deliver the best experience.

  - Actionable Insights â€“ Identified key factors impacting customer ratings, revealing if certain seat types correlate with lower satisfaction or how regional trends influence expectations.

What sets this project apart? Instead of just visualizing ratings, I focused on correlations between customer types, seat choices, and service expectations, creating a data-driven roadmap for airline service improvement. ðŸš€
